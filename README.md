Molokai-Terminal
================

Molokai-Terminal is a molokai-like theme for a 16-color terminal.  It is a
high-contrast theme, which is designed for general terminal application.  So if
an application looks good in the default linux's 16 color theme, it should also
look clear in Molokai-Terminal.  This makes Molokai-Terminal have a very good
compability.

There is also a modified vim's theme shipped with Molokai-Terminal.  It makes
use of both xterm-256 color and 16 terminal color to present a uniform
experience in terminal, vim and gvim.

Any comments are welcome!
